## What's this all about?

Welcome! This is the first video in the "From Start To Finish [Metalcore]" series where I am digging into a Metalcore mix I recently completed and explaining some of the lessons I learned and tools I used along the way.

Have you ever struggled with getting a live kick-in track to sit in a dense mix? Well, you are in the right place!

In this video, I discuss how I compressed and gated the live kick-in track, including how I used Sound Radix's Drum Leveler and FabFilter's Pro MB to help the kick hit hard in the mix.
