## What's this all about?

Have you ever worked with a drummer who had a **great snare grove** that just wasn't coming through in the mix, no matter how many **drum gates** you automated? Have you struggled to capture and mix clean, organic sounding snare ghost notes?

In recent years, I feel like there has been a renewed focus on drum dynamics in some corners of the heavy music world. With improvements in recording and mixing technology, it is now more possible than ever to build a **punchy, natural mix** that shows off all the nuances of a great drum arrangement.

In this video, I show you how I used **ghost note snare samples** in the mix to reinforce the dynamics of the drum performance in a way that sounds **larger than life**. You'll learn my process behind selecting samples, and the choices that go into shaping dynamic drum mixes in modern heavy music.
