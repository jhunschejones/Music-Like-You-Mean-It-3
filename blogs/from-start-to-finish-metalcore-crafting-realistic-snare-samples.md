## What's this all about?

Have you ever worked on a mix with no real snare recordings and found yourself wishing the overall feel of the parts could be just a little **more life-like**?

Crafting good drum tones with samples is a key skill to master in modern heavy music production. In this video, I discuss how I was able to create a **realistic feeling snare** sound in my mix despite the fact that the snare tracks from the original drum tracking session were super messed up!

While it is not my first choice when live recordings are an option, I have used this **time-tested approach** on several occasions to help improve an otherwise robotic feeling drum mix. Watch the video for more details on how I put together my main snare sound.

I have made sure to include **easy to follow steps and mindsets** to prepare you for the next time you need to breathe life into sampled drums!
