## What's this all about?

Are you looking to polish up some snare samples you created during your session, or maybe create some samples on your own for fun? This is a great video to get you started.

For this mix I didn't have a live snare top or bottom track to work with. Instead, I had to craft my **main snare tone out of multi-samples** taken during the session.

In this video I'll show you the processing I applied to help the snare samples sit better in the mix and **sound as natural as possible** so that you can use these approaches to improve your own snare samples. See you in there!
