## What's this all about?

Have you ever had to record drums in a space that was **too small**, or just didn't have enough mics and inputs to capture a good set of room tracks? Sure, reverb can help you create space, but a little goes a long way with modern heavy drum tones.

In this video, I show you how I was able to use a little creativity to take a problem with my recorded tracks and turn it into an opportunity. Along the way I talk about the processing I've done on the **drum room tracks** for this mix. Don't miss out on this one!
