## What's this all about?

Drum samples are a common part of many modern music genres, and if you listen to as much heavy music as I do, you have certainly heard your fair share of samples.

When used correctly, samples can **help your drums cut through the mix** with added consistency and larger-than-life attitude. Unfortunately, with great power comes great responsibility. It is easy to push things too far with samples and end up with a mix that is aggressively _unpleasant_ to listen to.

"Well then Josh", you might be asking, "**what's too little**, and **what's too much** when it comes to drum samples?"

I'm happy to show you! Let's start with the kick drum. In this video, I talk about how I used a sample to **reinforce the live kick** in this mix in order to deliver more **consistency** and some **in-your-face kick attack**. In the video I go through all the processing that I used and I even give away my _secret sauce_: the sample I use in almost every mix!
