Have you ever picked up a new record from a band you loved but found you couldn't make it all the way through because of how _harsh_ the cymbals sounded?

It can be tricky to clean up drum overheads for a present, modern drum sound, but **paying attention to detail** at this step will **save your listeners ears** later, I promise!

In this video, I take you through the processing on my main drum overhead tracks in this mix, including the exact EQ, compression, limiting, and saturation settings I used. More importantly, I talk about how I made these choices so that the final result sounds **modern and natural** without any painful or harsh high frequencies.
