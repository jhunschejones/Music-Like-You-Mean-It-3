## What's this all about?

While kick and snare make up a large part of your overall drum sound, the toms can provide a great opportunity to **distinguish the feel of a song**.

Different mixes present different challenges when it comes to toms. In this video I show how I processed some heavily edited toms to help them sound **more lifelike** and blend better with the **natural drum sound** I was working to achieve.

I explain the EQ I used as well as my go-to room reverb settings and the reasons I chose these specific tools. Finally, I touch on how I go about setting the level of my toms for a **huge drum sound** that doesnâ€™t take over the entire mix.
