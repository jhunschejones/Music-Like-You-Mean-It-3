## What's this all about?

Have you ever worked with a drum recording that sounded good on its own, but when you put it in the mix, the cymbals just did not **cut through the other instruments**?

Boosting the top end on your overheads will only get you so far, and cutting more low end can leave you with _harsh_, _unpleasant_ sounding cymbals.

In this video, I show you a different way to keep your natural overhead sound while **boosting the presence and clarity** of the cymbals in your mix. Itâ€™s the best of both worlds and a great tool to have at your disposal when you need it.
