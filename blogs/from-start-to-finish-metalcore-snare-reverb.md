## What's this all about?

Have you ever found yourself working in circles trying to **get your snare to hit harder in the mix** with compression, samples, clipping, and saturation? These are all important tools, but it’s likely that you have noticed there’s still _something missing_.

There have been several key moments during my mixing career where I noticed the quality of my mixes had **reached a new level**. One of these was when I discovered how much the space you create for your snare can affect how impactful it feels in the mix.

In this video, I show you the **two key reverb sounds** I use for the snare, including the exact settings I dialed in and the role each plays in the snare sound. This is crucial part of the drum mix to get right, and I want to help you have the same breakthroughs here that I did!
