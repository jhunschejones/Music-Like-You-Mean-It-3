## What's this all about?

Have you ever worked on a killer mix, only to be let down during a **key transition** when the performances just didn't **hit as hard** as they needed to? In more complex arrangements, it can be near impossible for even the best drummers to play **powerful, clear accents** after a complicated fill.

In this video, I show you how I use cymbal samples in my mix to **boost the energy** during key transitions and subtly reinforce drum parts where there wasn't enough space to get the **massive crash accents** the song calls for. Along the way I show you how I chose where to place samples, what processing I use, and how to know when you should take cymbal samples during a recording session.

After this video, you'll have a great new tool at your disposal for creating **larger-than-life overheads** for your next heavy mix!
